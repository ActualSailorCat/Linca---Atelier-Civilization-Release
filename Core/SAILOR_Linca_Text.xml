				In Atelier Ayesha, Linca works as Marion's bodyguard. She and Marion arrived from a land very far away for an important investigation. She's a devoted companion who is always thirsty for a good battle. She's a very skilled sword user, but is virtually clueless about everything in life outside of battle. Marion entrusts Linca to Ayesha and her party as a companion when they visit Hallos Village. Although Marion and Linca have a good relationship, Marion wishes for Linca to have more friends and to become better socialized. By travelling with Ayesha, Linca learns to cook, and begins to understand simple concepts better.

				Linca also admits that she wishes to have short hair and clothing more suitable for battle. Because Marion takes good care of her, Linca has never changed her appearance, all to please Marion. If Linca is the character with the highest friendship in the third year of the game when Ayesha's birthday event occurs, the player will recieve a Chain Shirt as a gift from Linca and Marion. After a character event, Linca will open a shop that is open during the bazaar, where the player can buy items from her.

			<Text>
				After the events of Atelier Ayesha, Linca has left the Land of Dusk and now works for the Colseit branch. Linca is a specialist in combat who supports Marion, and her sword skills are first class. Her main duties include subjugating monsters and searching for wanted criminals. She was assigned to the development team together with Marion, and becomes like a senior to Escha and Logy. Linca's clothes are still picked by Marion, and Linca continues to attempt to fulfill her goal of making 100 friends. It's still difficult for her to make friends, and is unable to act on a equal basis with Marion. But she is not hesitant in front of anyone, and her feelings for her companions are very strong

				Linca is introduced early in the story as Logy and Escha's senior colleague at work, shortly after the scene where Escha and Logy met for the first time. She is available as a playable party member and joins Escha and Logy in their investigations later in the game. Linca also has her own character ending.
